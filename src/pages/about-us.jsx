            AUTOMACOM (Automation Community) was born out of the desire to
            bridge the gap between theory and practical application in
            technology. Founded by a group of forward-thinking students at the
            University of Lagos, we recognized that while classroom learning is
            important, real-world, hands-on experience is what truly prepares us
            to make a difference in the field of Robotics, AI, IoT, and Embedded
            Systems. Our community, which is both student-based and student-led,
            has grown rapidly, creating a space where students collaborate,
            innovate, and work on projects that solve real problems,
            particularly those unique to Nigeria and Africa at large.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are a non-profit organization with the aim of raising
            well-rounded engineers who can create scalable, impactful solutions.
            Since our founding, we have focused on giving our members not only
            the tools and mentorship needed to succeed but also the opportunity
            to develop their skills through real projects from the very
            beginning.
